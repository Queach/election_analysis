Based on the information of these 2 years, ENPH seems likely to be a stable stock to invest in as in continues to deliver each year.

## Summary

- Advantages of Refactoring Code

The most obvious reason to refactor is the amount of time you save by reusing code that already works. Instead of taking the time to write everything from scratch
you are able to repurpose and tweak code in less than half the time. Another advantage of refactoring code is the ability to take old code
and make it more versatile and dynamic.

- Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

A disatvantage of refactoring code is that it is very easy to get lost in the code and not understand what it means. It becomes difficult
to use the code for it's intended purpose and if the code isn't well commented it may actually have the reverse effect and waste your time
trying to piece everything together.

- Refactoring in VBA

Refactoring in VBA is very similar to any other language. The advantage of the refactored code is that it is way more dynamic than the orignal code.
At the same time the code we wrote at the end of the day still only works in this particular data set. For that reason the original code was more precise
and took less time to write. The refactored code however has a shorter runtime than the original, if the client was running on an older computer
this code mean 10's of seconds and would be much less irritating.
