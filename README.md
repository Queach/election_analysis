## Summary

This shows that this script can accurately analyze voting data when given a raw csv file
As long as the data is collected and stored the same way as this election, it will be able to dynamically analyze the results as it was coded with that in mind

As seen in the image, candidates will be added dynamically and the script can be used for a larger dataset

All that needs to be modified is the csv file that is used to read the information, if you put a new file in with the same name, or change the path to the file
the script will run through it and produce similar results.
